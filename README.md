# ImageInLife Image Processing Library

ImageInLib is an image processing library created by the [ImageInLife](http://imageinlife.eu) teams from [Tatramed s.r.o](https://tatramed.sk) and [Slovak University of Technology](https://www.stuba.sk) for the **Training European Experts in Multilevel Bioimaging, Analysis and Modelling of Vertebrate Development and Disease**

## Features of the **ImageInLib**

The following image processing techniques have been implemented in the library:

* [Affine transformation](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Affine%20Transformation%20of%203D%20Images)
* [Distance functions](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Computing%20distance%20function%20on%20a%20pixel-based%20grid)
* [File management](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/File%20Management)
* [Image (Distance map) registration](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Image%20(Distance%20Map)%20Registration)
* [Image filtering](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Image%20Filtering)
* [Image segmentation](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Image%20Segmentation)
* [Noise generation](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Noise%20Generation)
* [Shape generation](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Shape-Generation)
* [Statistical shape analysis](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/Statistical%20Shape%20Analysis)

We also have a **[VTK Library](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/VTK-Library)** imaging library which offers support for reading and storing vtk files. Our chosen data format is vtk.

All the implementations are for **3D data** and uses the **C/C++** language. To use various functionalities please visit their respective pages.

### How To Use

To use this library, you must have an **existing C/C++ solution!**

1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the zip to a folder
3. Open the ImageInLib solution file in the extracted folder and build it. To find it see [solution file location](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/tree/master/ImageInLib)
3. To continue, the next steps can be found here --> [How To Use Library in an Existing Solution](https://github.com/ImageInLib/ImageInLib/wiki/how_to_use)
